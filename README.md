# GUNNY SHOP WEBSITE

**INTRODUCTION**

This is a project that I developed when **I was 16 years old** while exploring the orginal gunny source code. The project is a website that allows users to try on items (clothes, hats, weapons) on the character and take a photo of the character with items on. It is inspired by the game Gunny (a popular game in Vietnam at that time).

**DISCALIMER**

1. The code quality is not good, but it works.
2. The frontend is not responsive.
3. The game assets are copyrighted by the game publisher. I will not provide the game assets in this repo. (you can contact me for downloading them, serving for only educational purposes).
4. The project is not maintained anymore.
