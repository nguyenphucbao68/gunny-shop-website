# GUNNY SHOP WEBSITE

**INTRODUCTION**

This is a project that I developed when **I was 16 years old** while exploring the orginal gunny source code. The project is a website that allows users to try on items (clothes, hats, weapons) on the character and take a photo of the character with items on. The project is inspired by the game Gunny (a popular game in Vietnam at that time). The project is developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, and JS.

**DISCALIMER**

1. The code quality is not good, but it works.
2. The theme is not responsive.
3. The game assets are copyrighted by the game publisher. I will not provide the game assets in this repo. (you can contact me for downloading them, serving for only educational purposes).
